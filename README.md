- **Privacy-first** - No data sent to third-party servers

## Installation

### Manual Installation
1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/jeroenwk/drpbx-fetcher/releases)
2. Extract the files to your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/drpbx-fetcher/` directory
3. Reload Obsidian
4. Enable the plugin in the Community Plugins settings

## Setup

### 1. Create a Dropbox App

1. Go to the [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps)
2. Click "Create app"
3. Choose "Scoped access"
4. Choose "Full Dropbox" access
5. Name your app (e.g., "My Obsidian Sync")
6. In the app settings, add redirect URIs:
   - **Desktop**: `http://localhost:53134/callback`
   - **Mobile** (iOS/Android): `obsidian://dropbox-callback`
7. Under "Permissions", enable:
   - `files.metadata.read`
   - `files.content.read`
8. Copy your "App key" (this is your Client ID)

### 2. Configure the Plugin

1. Go to Settings > Dropbox Fetcher
2. Paste your Dropbox app Client ID
3. Click "Authenticate" to connect to Dropbox
4. Complete the OAuth flow in your browser

### 3. Add Folder Mappings

1. In the plugin settings, find the "Folder Mappings" section
2. Enter a remote Dropbox path (e.g., `/Documents/Notes`)
3. Enter a local vault path (e.g., `ImportedNotes`)
4. Click "Add" to save the mapping

**Example mapping:**
- Remote path: `/home/Viwoods-PDF/AiPaper/S3AA2303M02672/Picking`
- Local path: `Picking`

This will sync all files from the Dropbox folder to `YourVault/Picking/`

## Usage

### Automatic Sync
The plugin automatically syncs all configured folders when Obsidian starts (with a 3-second delay to allow Obsidian to fully load).

### Manual Sync
- **Ribbon Icon**: Click the sync icon in the left sidebar
- **Command Palette**: Use the "Sync Dropbox files" command (Ctrl/Cmd+P)
- **Settings**: Click the "Sync" button in the plugin settings

### Sync Behavior
- Files are downloaded from Dropbox and processed based on file type
- File processors can extract content and generate markdown files
- Subdirectories are created automatically
- Files with the same size are skipped (assumed to be up-to-date)
- Existing files with different sizes are overwritten

### File Processors (New!)

The plugin can intelligently process different file types during sync:

**viwoods Notes (.note files)**
- Extract text highlights from EPUB reader format
- Extract EPUB files from .note archives
- Generate organized highlight markdown files
- Use custom templates for output formatting
- **Coming soon**: Handwriting and annotation extraction
- **[Quick Start Guide](docs/viwoods-setup.md)**

**Coming Soon**
- PDF annotation extraction
- EPUB highlights processing
- Image metadata extraction
- And more...

**[üìñ Read the File Processors Documentation](docs/FILE-PROCESSORS.md)**

## Development

### Building the plugin

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/jeroendezwart/drpbx-fetcher.git
cd drpbx-fetcher

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for development (with watch mode)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

The compiled plugin will be in the `dist` directory.

### Development workflow

1. Clone the repository to your vault's plugins folder:
   ```
   /path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/drpbx-fetcher/
   ```
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development build with watch mode
4. Make changes to the code
5. Reload Obsidian (Ctrl/Cmd+R) to test your changes

## Mobile Support (iOS/Android)

**‚úÖ This plugin now supports mobile devices!**

### Mobile Setup

1. Install the plugin on your mobile device
2. Make sure you've added `obsidian://dropbox-callback` as a redirect URI in your Dropbox app settings (see Setup step 1.6)
3. In plugin settings, enter your Client ID
4. Tap "Authenticate"
5. You'll be redirected to Dropbox in your external browser (Safari/Chrome)
6. After authorizing, you'll automatically return to Obsidian
7. Configure your folder mappings and sync!

### Mobile Considerations

- **OAuth Flow**: Opens your default browser for authentication
- **Large Files**: May take longer to download on mobile networks
- **Background Sync**: Not supported on mobile - use manual sync
- **Auto-sync**: Works on app startup (after 3-second delay)

### Platform Differences

The plugin automatically detects your platform and adapts:
- **Desktop**: Uses localhost OAuth server
- **Mobile**: Uses custom URI scheme (`obsidian://dropbox-callback`)
- Settings UI shows platform-specific instructions

## Security and Privacy

- This plugin uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for secure authentication
- Your access token and refresh token are stored locally in Obsidian's settings
- The plugin only accesses folders you explicitly configure
- No data is sent to third-party servers (except Dropbox API)
- All file downloads are direct from Dropbox to your local vault

## Troubleshooting

### "Port 53134 is already in use"
This means another process is using the OAuth callback port. Wait a few moments and try authenticating again.

### "No valid Dropbox access token"
Click "Authenticate" in the plugin settings to reconnect to Dropbox.

### Files not syncing
1. Check that your folder mappings are correct
2. Verify your Dropbox app has the correct permissions
3. Check the console (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+I) for error messages
4. Try manually syncing from the settings page

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have feature requests:

1. Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jeroenwk/drpbx-fetcher/issues) page
2. Create a new issue if your problem hasn't been reported
